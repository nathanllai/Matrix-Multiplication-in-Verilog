# Matrix-Multiplication-in-Verilog
The goal of this project was to program hardware in Verilog to compute matrix multiplication between two input 8x8 matrices of 8 bit numbers. Another objective was to implement parallelism and pipelining to speed up the calculations. 

Input: Two 8x8 matrices of 8-bit signed numbers
Output: A 8x8 matrix of 19-bit signed numbers
